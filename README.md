## Repository structure
This repository contains solutions of three tasks:

 * matrix_task - the goal was to create an NxN matrix that would support operations like addition, subtraction and multiplication. The solution uses i.a. operator overloading, class methods and static methods.

 * banks_task - the goal was to create a simple banking simulator. The program should be able to store client information in banks, perform cash input and withdrawal as well as money transfer from client to client. The aim of this task was to practice using built-in Python types (dictionaries and lists), so writing custom classes or too many functions was prohibited. Solution should use JSON file as a pseudo-database.

 * testing_task - the goal was to create some unit tests for previous task.
